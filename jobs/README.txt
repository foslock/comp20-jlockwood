COMP20 - Lab 7 (and Lab 8)

1. I implemented an HTML page (job.html) that parses the included JSON string and manipulates the inner HTML of the "list" div object in the body. Each job list is displayed in a simple box that changes color when hovered over.

1b. UPDATED FOR LAB 8 - I removed the static JSON string and added an AJAX call that pulls the job listings from the provided address.

2. I collaborated with no one on this assignment.

3. This assignment took me approximately 20 minutes.
