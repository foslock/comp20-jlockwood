COMP20 - Lab 7

1. I implemented an HTML page (job.html) that parses the included JSON string and manipulates the inner HTML of the "list" div object in the body. Each job list is displayed in a simple box that changes color when hovered over.

2. I collaborated with no one on this assignment.

3. This assignment took me approximately 20 minutes.
