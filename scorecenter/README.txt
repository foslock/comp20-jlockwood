COMP20 - Assignment 5

1. I implemented an API (using Node.js, express, and Heroku as the server host) that accepts input in the form of scores for online games. There is a website (http://highscores-api.herokuapp.com) that shows the current database information (games and their scores). Also there is a page where you can search for a specific user's scores.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone for my assignment, but I did work with Urs Berger a little bit giving him some advice when working with Node.js and express.

3. This assignment took me about 8 hours total.
