COMP20 - Final Lab

1. This repository represents the work completed for COMP20 (Web Programming) at Tufts University.

2. Assignments 2 and 4 (the complete frogger project) were my favorites. Making games is always fun.

3. I am most proud of my Frogger project (http://foslock.github.io/frogger), I've showed it to a lot of my friends.

4. I have lots of experience in computer science (I'm was a senior when I took this) but didn't know much about web programming. This class exposed me to everything I was initially curious about and made it possible for me to explore web programming more deeply.
