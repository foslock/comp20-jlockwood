COMP20 - Lab 7

1. I implemented a HTML file with associated styling and javascript to draw the Ms. Pac-Man background, the Ms. Pac-Man sprite, and a ghost on an HTML5 canvas.

2. I didn't collaborate with anyone. I refered back to my frogger code for some reference.

3. This took me about 15 minutes to complete.
