COMP20 - Assignment 4

1. This is the updated version of Frogger, a more interactive (and fun) version of what I implemented in assigment 2. Use the arrow keys to move Frogger around, or swipes if you are on a touch screen device. I've implemented the basic scoring system and the rest of the basic requirements, here is a list of additional features:
- The timer counts down (and gets faster as you beat more levels!)
- The 'dead_frog.png' sprite shows and animates when the frog has died
- The levels slowly get harder (more cars, less time) as you level up
- There is a "LEVEL UP" graphic when you beat a level and a "GAMEOVER" graphic when you lose.
- The game works on touch devices (iPhone, iPad, Android phones, etc.) using swipes. The only console output is from the default viewport arguments you've showed us.
- NOTE: I did this before I knew jQuery was allowed, so that is why you will see no jQuery in my code.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone, but the links you provided on the assigment page (the mozilla tutorial especially) were very helpful.

3. I spent approximately 12 hours on this assignment.
