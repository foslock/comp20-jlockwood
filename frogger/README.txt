COMP20 - Assignment 2

1. I have implemented the beginnings of the Frogger game engine in Javascript. There is a draw function that takes care of the rendering, and a step function that will be called to update the game's logic.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone, but the links you provided on the assigment page (the mozilla tutorial especially) were very helpful.

3. I spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment.
