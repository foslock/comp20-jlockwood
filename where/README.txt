COMP20 - Assignment 3

1. I implemented a webpage that renders the MBTA's red line on an interactive google map canvas using custom markers and a red polyline. When a station is clicked, an info window is shown live data about upcoming train arrivals. Also shown on the map is a marker representing your current location, with a distance to the nearest T stop. In addition, Carmen and Waldo are rendered (if data was given) and your distance to them is shown in an overlay.

2. I didn't collaborate with anyone for this assignment, but the google maps API reference was incredibly helpful.

3. I spent about 6 hours on this assignment.
